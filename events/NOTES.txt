The apps are working but not communicating with each other.
Need to fix it.

To run:

1. Build and deploy nats servers, dispatcher and receiver components

    $ make up

2. Monitory dispatcher (open new terminal)

    $ make tail-dispatcher

3. Monitor reiver (open new terminal)

    $ make tail-receiver
